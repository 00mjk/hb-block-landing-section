## Description

A full width grid template for landing page sections.

The grid template provides three fluid sets of tracks which provide a means of
displaying content at 1:1, 3:2 and 16:9 aspect ratios plus full width (when this
is larger than 16:9). The tracks have minimum widths based on the widest available
'normal' monitor aspect ratio with a resolution of 3440x1440 aka ultrawide. The
central tracks creating the 1:1 space will never be narrower than 40% of the browser
width to prevent over shrinking when the browser is squished vertically.
